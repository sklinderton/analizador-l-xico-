The big cat sits.
A small dog runs in the house.
The red car is on the table.
An old man walks with a young woman.
The happy child reads a blue book.
A tall tree stands in the garden.
The small cat sleeps under the big table.
A green flower is by the old house.
The sad woman sits on a red chair.
A big dog error test.
The cat runs
An invalid word test.
The big small cat sits.
